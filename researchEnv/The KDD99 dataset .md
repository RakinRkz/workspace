The KDD99 dataset consists of various columns or attributes that describe different features of network connections. The columns or attributes provide information about the characteristics of each network connection, and these attributes are used as inputs to train and test intrusion detection models. Here are some of the commonly used column labels in the KDD99 dataset:

1. **duration**: The duration of the connection in seconds.
2. **protocol_type**: The protocol used for the connection (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
3. **service**: The service on the destination machine that is being accessed (e.g., http, ftp, telnet).
4. **flag**: The status of the connection (e.g., SF for normal, S0 for connection attempt, REJ for rejected).
5. **src_bytes**: The number of data bytes transferred from the source to the destination.
6. **dst_bytes**: The number of data bytes transferred from the destination to the source.
7. **land**: Indicator of whether the connection is from/to the same host/port (1 if true, 0 if false).
8. **wrong_fragment**: The number of wrong fragments.
9. **urgent**: The number of urgent packets.
10. **hot**: The number of "hot" indicators (a measure of how many connections to the same host are in the current session).
11. **num_failed_logins**: The number of failed login attempts.
12. **logged_in**: Indicator of whether the user is logged in (1 if true, 0 if false).
13. **num_compromised**: The number of compromised conditions.
14. **root_shell**: Indicator of whether a root shell was obtained (1 if true, 0 if false).
15. **su_attempted**: Indicator of whether the "su root" command was attempted (1 if true, 0 if false).
16. **num_root**: The number of root accesses.
17. **num_file_creations**: The number of file creation operations.
18. **num_shells**: The number of shell prompts.
19. **num_access_files**: The number of accesses to sensitive files.
20. **num_outbound_cmds**: The number of outbound commands in an ftp session.
21. **is_host_login**: Indicator of whether the login belongs to the "host" category (1 if true, 0 if false).
22. **is_guest_login**: Indicator of whether the login is a guest login (1 if true, 0 if false).
23. **count**: The number of connections to the same host as the current connection.
24. **srv_count**: The number of connections to the same service as the current connection.
25. **serror_rate**: The percentage of connections that have "SYN" errors.
26. **srv_serror_rate**: The percentage of connections to the same service that have "SYN" errors.
27. **rerror_rate**: The percentage of connections that have "REJ" errors.
28. **srv_rerror_rate**: The percentage of connections to the same service that have "REJ" errors.
29. **same_srv_rate**: The percentage of connections to the same service.
30. **diff_srv_rate**: The percentage of connections to different services.
31. **srv_diff_host_rate**: The percentage of connections to different hosts among the connections to the same service.
32. **dst_host_count**: The number of connections to the same host.
33. **dst_host_srv_count**: The number of connections to the same service on the destination host.
34. **dst_host_same_srv_rate**: The percentage of connections to the same service on the destination host.
35. **dst_host_diff_srv_rate**: The percentage of connections to different services on the destination host.
36. **dst_host_same_src_port_rate**: The percentage of connections from the same source port to the same host.
37. **dst_host_srv_diff_host_rate**: The percentage of connections to different hosts among the connections to the same service on the destination host.
38. **dst_host_serror_rate**: The percentage of connections to the same host that have "SYN" errors.
39. **dst_host_srv_serror_rate**: The percentage of connections to the same service on the destination host that have "SYN" errors.
40. **dst_host_rerror_rate**: The percentage of connections to the same host that have "REJ" errors.
41. **dst_host_srv_rerror_rate**: The percentage of connections to the same service on the destination host that have "REJ" errors.

These are just some of the columns that can be found in the KDD99 dataset. The dataset includes many more attributes that capture various aspects of network connections, their behaviors, and potential anomalies or attacks.
